# 472_assignment_template

This repository contains two files:

1) `template.Rmd` is an example RMarkdown file which contains the necessary code to meet the formatting requirements for MY472 assignments
2) `template.html` is the knitted version of this file, to demonstrate how this formatting renders in practice
